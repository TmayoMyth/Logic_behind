What is MachineLearning?
Machine Learning is an algorithm that is able
- to learn from data
- to find pattern within data to make intelligent decision


Traditional ML System
- model relies on expert's decision of input features

Representation ML System
- choose features by model itself

Supervised learning
- data have labels
1. Train
 - input correctly classified data
 - model compare predicted label and actual label
 - give feedback about comparison and
 - use this to adjust model parameters
 
2. Feature vector
 - each data point is input as vectore
 - these are called feature vectors (or x variables )

3. Labels (Y variables)
 - labels can be categorical(mostly binary data) or continuous values
 
4. statistics
 - dealing with continuous data needs basic understanding of statistics
 1) mean value (average value)
  - representation of all data
 2) variance
  - variance = sum of squred difference / (n - 1)
 3) Standard deviation 
  - square root of variance
 
 5. data standardiztion
  - Each data is standardize by using
   ( data - mean(data) ) / ( standard deviation(data) )
  - why?
   - ML models work best on standardized values
   - prevent some high variance data series from dominating
