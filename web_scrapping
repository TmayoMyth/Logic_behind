Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites through an automated process.
Use Cases
There are many reasons and use cases why you would want to scrape data. Let me list some of them:

  scrape pages of a e-retailer to spot if some of the clothes you want to buy got discounted
  compare prices of several clothes brands by scraping their pages
  price of the flight tickets can vary during the day. One could crawl the travel website and get alarmed once the price was lowered
  analyze the action websites to answer the question if starting bid should be low or high to attract more bidders or if the longer auction correlates with a higher end bid
